# surfs_up

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The purpose of this analysis is to dive more deeply into the weather data, specifically on temperature trends, to inform whether or not opening a surf and ice cream shop in Oahu is a good idea. This analysis looks at temperature trends during two months, June and December, to inform whether the surf and ice cream shop business will be sustainable year-round. From a skills standpoint, this challenge tests our ability to use sqlalchemy to query the database, convert the relevant data into a dataframe and obtain summary statistics.


## Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

## Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
